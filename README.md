# framework-to-send-simulated-CAN-data-to-hardware
we mainly focus on designing a framework to send CAN bus data to hardware.
the data is simulated in CAN bus master tool and send to raspberry pi for processing.
Thiswork mainly focuses on creating a framework for visualizing the data whichwas received from bus master.
